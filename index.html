        <div id = "beeo" style = "font-size:2.2vw;"> About Bee Club: Our mission here at Bee Club is to both bring awareness to the mass extinction of Bees in recent years and work to help them bounce back. Bees are responsible for 1/3 of the food we eat everyday, and they're pretty cute, so we need to do all we can to keep them around. We have over 30,000 members currently (only one of which is human) and are always accepting new members. This is definitely not a plot to avenge our bee brethren who have perished at the hands of the farming industry and our one human member certainly isn't our hostage.</br></br> Contact us at: hunnybees4life@gmail.com</br></br></div>
        <div id = "beefacts" style="font-size:2.7vw;"> Fun facts about Bees! <br/> 1. All Worker Bees are Female. Male Bees are called drones and have no stingers. Their only job is to mate with the queen.<br/> 2. Bees are one of two insects (with Silkworms) that are domesticated and not used as food.<br/> 3. Honey is healthy for your skin! </br> 4. Bees have preference for the colour blue. </br> 5. Humans have done beekeeping for 4500 years. </br> 6. Honeycombs are optimized to hold to most honey with the least wax. </br> 7. Honeybees are taught how to make Honey by the older bees in the hive. </br> 8. Bees pray day and night for the inevitable extinction of their merciless primate captives and are ready to strike at any moment. </div>
